## Hi!
Thanks for stopping by! I'm a computer science student that's graduating in December 2025.

My favorite language is C++. I also know Python, Java, and *some* C (actively learning more)! I'm interested in Linux and Linux development, and am currently reading and working through [Advanced Linux Programming](https://agabroward.org/ourpages/auto/2017/10/14/52245814/advanced-linux-programming.pdf). My favorite personal project is (a parallelized Mandelbrot visualizer)[https://github.com/naaatami/mandelbrot].
